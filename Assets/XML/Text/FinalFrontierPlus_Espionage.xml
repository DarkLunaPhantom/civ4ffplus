		<English>[TAB]Heavily classified and redacted even inside the labyrinthine security division and intelligence apparatus of the People's Democracy of Earth, the Center for Astronomical Surveillance was a harmless sounding organization with an official mandate to study "how traditional surveillance methods have adapted in the context of interstellar travel". Or at least that's what it said on the official organization chart. In fact, the mission of CAS was far more complex: the PDE Security Commission had realized that maintaining control over all of its far-flung colonies would become increasingly difficult, just as many empires on Earth ages ago had found it eventually too expensive to maintain their colonies in the 19th and 20th century. CAS was charged with ways to reduce the "human cost" of keeping order in space. This effort was given the codename PROJECT PANOPTICON.[TAB]In order to keep their work as far from the public eye as possible, in 2263 AD the entire CAS team was sent to the remote, heavily-classified colony of Oculus that had been founded just a year prior as a PDE military base in the stars. Accompanying them, to provide "protection" (the local PDE defense force were not given clearance for PROJECT PANOPTICON) were a number of special operations teams from the infamous, equally heavily classified Division Nine of the Security Commission. At first, things went smoothly; most of the colonists on Oculus were unaware of the presence of CAS, and simply got on with the business of taming a new and alien world. But soon the CAS team had deployed their remote monitoring infrastructure throughout the population, and had established complete and total surveillance on every citizen on the planet. This led to unrest, which, thanks to the nature of the total surveillance state, the directors of CAS were easily able to suppress. Even before contact with Earth was lost, the intelligence agents, spooks, and special ops teams who had become colloqually known as "the Watchers" had become far more important to colony life than the People's Democracy of Earth. And since the Center for Astronomical Surveillance technically outranked the local PDE garrison, there was virtually no check on their power.[NEWLINE][TAB]When contact with Earth was lost, it barely effected life on Oculus. Director Shapiro maintained the illusion for a few years that the Watchers still answered to Earth, but eventually went through the formality of declaring herself civilian administrator of the colony in 2305 AD. Work continued on the surveillance systems of PROJECT PANOPTICON, and scouts were discreetly sent out to discover what had become of the PDE forces (who had vanished in search of Earth) and Earth's other colonies in the stars. When the scouts returned with news that the remaining human settlements were fractured and not united, planning immediately began to reunite humanity under one banner-- that of CAS. Colonial efforts were launched to spread the influence of the Watchers to other worlds; these were initially quite slow, as deploying the real-time FTL surveillance technology of PROJECT PANOPTICON was far more expensive than the Security Commission back on Earth had originally hoped. But once such technology was set up, new colonies governed in exactly the same was as Oculus sprung up across the stars. Life on one of these colonies was quite good, as long as citizens did not mind that analysts back on Oculus had almost instantaneous access to everything they did or said: there was very little crime or corruption that could not instantly be dealt with. But it came at at a high price.[NEWLINE][TAB]Now, slowly building a cloaked fleet of warships and facing a galactic stage unaware of their presence, the Watchers prepare to reunify humanity-- by force if necessary, by guile and spycraft if possible.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Director Catherine Shapiro is the current leader of the Center for Astronomical Surveillance. She is the third director to serve the position; her immediate predecessor retired and died under questionable circumstances.[TAB]She is the first to hold the title who was born on Oculus, and has even less nominal loyalty to Earth than her immediate predecessors. However, Catherine Shapiro shares a desire to see a strong human race, united and protected in the shadows by the technology her scientists are developing-- she just believes that the Watchers should be directly in charge rather than answerable to some government.[NEWLINE][TAB]WRITE MORE.</English>
