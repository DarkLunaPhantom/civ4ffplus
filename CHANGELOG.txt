Final Frontier Plus Changelog History:

Changelogs for 1.9 beta releases:

v1.9b1 Changelog:
-Added a ninth human colony, Interstellar Intelligence, an espionage-focused
faction, aka "the Watchers", based off a suggestion by Imp Knoedel. Trait
grants Improved Stealth to all Light Ships and a bonus to espionage production,
at a cost to upkeep.
-Imported sailbotlieh's Miranda Lawson (imported from Mass Effect 2) leaderhead
for Catherine Shapiro, the leader of the Watchers. Favorite civic is Police State.
-Added Stealth Cruiser UU for the Watchers; a more expensive Stealth Ship
that gets first strikes.
-Added Security Directorate UB for the Watchers; an Intelligence Center that
produces more Espionage.
-Added Galactic Infiltration technology to the beginning of the Expansion Era.
-Galactic Infiltration allows the training of the new Spy Ship unit, a spy
that can perform Spy Missions but is not 100% invisible; it is only "invisible
to most units" ala a Stealth Ship.
-Re-enabled the No Espionage gameoption (that prevents the building of Spies and
turns all Espionage into other commerces).
-Added No Spies gameoption that prevents the building of spies, but still
lets buildings produce Espionage culture.
